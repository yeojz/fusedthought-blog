In the past week, I had a project which required me to implement a server-to-api upload of  images. Being client-side oriented, I didn't think much of the issue, until I hit a snag — actually creating the multipart request.

The python *urllib2* and *poster* libraries helped alot, but somehow, I was still getting 401, 400, and sometimes 215 twitter error codes. Weeks in and multiple searches on the internet didn't lead to anything much.

But finally, I hit the solution… a solution so simple that I could tear, and a solution which I tried on a whim:
	
> **Removal of the "status" field before OAuth signing request is made.** 

I was already **removing the "media[]" field**. But it didn't occur to me that "status" needs to be removed as well, nor did I suspect it to be the cause of my problems.

This requirement was also not mentioned in the Twitter API docs. It may be in the OAuth protocol, but I didn't look into that, so I don't really know.

Anyway, here's some sample code. Hopefully it will save someone from unnecessary code-wrestling. 

**Python**:

	import httplib
	import oauth
	from poster.encode import multipart_encode
	from poster.streaminghttp import register_openers
	

	# Registering poster's methods
	register_openers()


	# Defining OAuth method
	signature_method = oauth.OAuthSignatureMethod_HMAC_SHA1()


	# Some API Settings
	domain = "http://api.twitter.com"
	url = domain + "/1.1/statuses/update_with_media.json"
	consumer = oauth.OAuthConsumer(KEY, SECRET)


	# Creating the signing request
	# Note the parameter field is set to None. {} works too
    req = oauth.OAuthRequest.from_consumer_and_token(
            consumer, 
            token=TOKEN, 
            http_url=url,
            parameters=None, 
            http_method="POST")
   	req.sign_request(signature_method, consumer, TOKEN)


	# I'm using httplib here. urllib2 should be possible as well
   	conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(domain)


	# Set the actual content
   	content = {
   		'status': "YOUR STATUS MESSAGE",
   		'media[]': "YOUR MEDIA" # Can be open(media, 'rb') or maybe urllib2.urlopen(media).read()
   	}


	# Generate multipart data and headers from content
   	datagen, headers = multipart_encode(content)


	# Append OAuth Authorization headers to generated headers
   	headers.update(req.to_header())


	# Body to string
   	body = "".join(datagen)


	# Make your request
   	conn.request("POST", req.get_url_location, body, headers)


	# Get Result
   	response = conn.getResponse()
   	print response.read()
