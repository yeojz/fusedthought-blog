Stalin was constantly suspecting a coup or assassination, as well as conspiracies against him.

There was a need to rid the country of anti-Communist elements. Stalin wanted total power for himself and wanted to terrify and disorientate population to prevent assembly of rebels. There were internal party rivalries, while the NEP worsened and thus needed a scapegoat for its failings. There were serious differences over how society develops and stability was required to build a country as quickly as possible. These reasons accounted for Stalin’s purges.

Target groups of purges were technocrats, managers, military led by Trotsky and political opponents.

Engineers, managers and planners of the First 5 year plan [Mensheviks background] in pre-1934 were used as purged and used as scapegoats as industrialization was not going smoothly.

Kirov, second in charge and party secretary in Leningrad, was murdered by the secret police in 1934, because he was more popular than Stalin, and Stalin feared Kirov would replace him. Furthermore Kirov had criticized Stalin’s role in speech, and was seen as a political opponent, especially since he won the highest number of votes. Following Kirov’s purge, purges were no longer selective. Kirov’s assassination was used as a pretext for unleashing terror upon old enemies and potential Nikolaev. These caused almost 1 million associate deaths.

An extraordinary law denouncing trial for those accused of terrorist activities was passed and made provision for quick investigation and execution. Party membership no longer protected one from death, here onwards.

Great Purge included purges that were massive and unselective. All levels of society were affected. Purging of party on a huge scale took place. Old Bolsheviks were completely wiped out and long-term members who did not owe their positions to Stalin were removed. Show Trials were broadcasted to instill fear in people. Purges often coincided with an internal crisis and served to provide a scapegoat for any political/economic failure. Victims were made to confess to absurd crimes, assuming that their actions would save their families.

Court Cases were part of Stalin’s purges. Trial of 16 in 1936 targeted leading members of party and state administration. Kamenev and Zinoviev were executed on the basis of being a terrorist group. 1937 trial of 17 purged Radek and 16 others who helped Stalin against Kamenev and Zinoviev.

1937 Military Trial led to execution of top leaders of red army. 40-50 % of senior leaders and 20% to 30% of junior officers were killed. They were charged on the basis of treason and accused of Trotskyism. They were a likely source of resistance as they were once Trotsky’s followers.

1938 Trial of 21 purged right wing members who were charged with spying, treason and accused of exterminating top soviet leaders. 1934 Top &amp; Regional Party officials, with the exception of Stalin’s associates and all politburo members were accused of anti-Leninism and ignoring orders from the centre. They were thus purged. This trial was used to settle old scores between Stalin and enemies.

1930s Mass Purges purged non-Russians, peasants to whom resisted collectivization, intelligentsia, critiques, poets, professors, workers and the church. They were removed as they criticized government policies, and to prevent opposition from massing. Stalin also wanted to remove potential assassins amongst them.

Purges disrupted livelihoods of people, and there was an economic slowdown due to a drastic decrease in the workforce. There was a decline in labour productivity, workers were not motivated, while the industries’ best technical experts were lost, and thus, industries slowed down. The best brains and talents disappeared and with that, Russia’s economic vibrancy ceased to exist.<br />
2/3 of the army was purged, with war veterans removed. The army became ineffective as never before.
