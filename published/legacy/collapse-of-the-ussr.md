In December 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed and the communist dominance ended. This is due to many years of mismanaged economy and unsound policies.

There were already domestic difficulties in the 1980s. Living standards were lagging and there was a persistent shortage food production. The economy was inefficient and over-centralised, consumer needs were largely neglected and basic needs were not met. Also, the 15% military budget was a drain of productive resources. A totalitarian state had emerged with little civil rights and political freedom under the Soviet communist regime.

Facing both economic and political problems since coming to power in 1985, Gorbachev attempted to solve them through Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring). However these policies sowed seeds for USSR’s breakup. Perestroika aimed to accelerate reforms to overcome problems of command economy and its features included decentralization of economic control and planning, campaigns to increase workers’ productivity, pay incentives, withdrawal of state subsidies for inefficient industries, privatization of industries and subsidies for goods. Glasnost allowed for public debate to gain support for reforms of Perestroika, and involvement of members of society. Members of society can voice constructive criticisms on shortcomings of economy and government.

As a result of the unpopular Perestroika, economic growth was 2.3% instead of 4%, there was soaring inflation, shortage of basic consumer goods, long food queues, public demanded for quicker remedies and finally, there were large scale strikes and demonstrations calling for more radical reforms. Glasnost had allowed for political relaxation and led to demands of democratization and overhaul of command economy. It was a host of many problems and caused problems of country to be subjects of public discussion. Poverty, corruption, enormous mismanagement of country’s resources and unpopularity of Afghan War arose. Ironically, Gorbachev and government was the target of most criticisms, as the public demanded for more western style reforms.

Perestroika and Glasnost unleashed revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, leading to fall of communist governments. Opposition leaders spread views on the government, resulting in undermining of communist parties and emergence of democratic forces like trade unions and pro-democratic leaders who ousted corrupt communist regimes and planned for free elections. This process began in Poland and spread to rest of Eastern Europe culminating in the fall of Berlin Wall. Gorbachev did not intervene and refused to apply the Brezhnev Doctrine as USSR had lots of problems and he had little power or resources to stop these changes.

Soviet republics, encouraged by what happened to Eastern European satellite states, began to issue declarations of independence. Perestroika and Glasnost had loosened the tight political control of these sates and renewed calls for independence by different nationalities. The sympathetic Gorbachev did not stop these demands and in 1990, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia declared themselves to be independent. Gorbachev lessened Moscow control, giving individual republics more decision-making powers. This new arrangement was concluded in the Union Treaty.

By August 1991, opposition within the communist party had intensified. Gorbachev’s constant maneuvering between the Left, which demanded for radical reforms towards market economy), and the Right, which opposed radical changes, was being seen as indecisive and his political position was weakened due to inability to solve USSR’s problems. Union Treaty was also seen by the Right as a key to disintegrate USSR. On 19th November 1991, Yanayev headed a group of hardliners and staged a coup to overthrow Gorbachev. Gorbachev was put under house arrest and announced that he had resigned due to health reasons and a state of emergency was declared. Military was dispatched to enforce the new government.

However the coup failed after 3 days when Boris Yeltsin and the Democrats rallied against it. The army did not shoot and a peaceful revolution took place. Coup leaders were arrested and the traditional communists were discredited. Gorbachev suspended the Communist Party and resigned as Party Secretary. Yeltsin had negotiated for a weaker union for the republics than the proposed one in Union Treaty, giving republics more autonomy and no president. With the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States on 31st December 1991, USSR ceased to exist and Yeltsin remained President.
