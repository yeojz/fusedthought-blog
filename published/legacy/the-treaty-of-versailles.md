The Treaty of Versailles aimed to preserve peace, prevent another world war and to weaken and punish the aggressors. The Treaty had territorial, military, economic and political terms.

The territorial terms were to weaken the aggressor, allow for self-determination and restore captured land. Alsace-Lorraine was transferred to France with Germans being expelled. Eupen, Morenset and Malmédy were transferred to Belgium, leading to its restoration. North Schleswig was transferred to Denmark. West Prussia, Posen and Upper Silesia, also known as the Polish Corridor was transferred to Poland. It cut off East Prussia from Germany, making it difficult to rule. Danzig became a free city under the League of Nations with foreign affairs under Poland. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were made independent. Memel was transferred to Lithuania. The Saar was to be under the League for 15 years. Anschluss was forbidden as self-determination not applied to losers of war. Rhineland was to be demilitarized for 15 years under Allied control.

Shantung and North Pacific Islands were given to Japan. Namibia was given to South Africa. For German trading concessions, they ended in China, Morocco and elsewhere. This meant a loss of trade and investment. The Rhine, Upper Danube, Kiel Canal, Elbe and Oder (waterways) were put under international control for freedom of trade. Germany lost 12.5% of population, 13.5% of land, 15% of farm production, 16% of coal production, 48% of iron production and her sovereignty.

The military terms aimed to weaken Germany and prevent further aggression. The German army was cut to 100000 men and there were no conscription, military aircraft, armored cars, tanks or heavy artillery. The German navy was restricted to 15000 navy officers, 6 cruisers, 6 battleships of limited tonnage, 12 destroyers, no submarines and a handful of smaller vessels. German High Sea Fleet was sunk by Germany when Allies wanted control of it. Rhineland was permanently demilitarized and no German troops were allowed there. In the West Bank and 50km radius of the East Bank, fortifications were destroyed. An Allied Army of Occupation was stationed there for 15 years to uphold the terms.  This would prevent Germany from attacking France again.

The economic terms aimed to weaken Germany and help the Allies recover through reparations. The War Guilt Clause provided legal justification for Allied Claims for reparations. Germany and her allies were made to accept sole responsibility for starting the war. Reparations were decided at £6600 million in 1921 to ensure that the German economy was kept tight to prevent them from prospering and spreading aggression. Reparations could be in cash and kind in annual installments over 42 years. Bulk of the payment would go to France and there was to bean immediate payment of £1000 million.

Germans were upset and protested. In December 1922, Germany did not make payments, claiming it was beyond her ability given the dire economic conditions. In January 1923, French and Belgian troops invaded Ruhr and seized £40 million worth of goods, causing campaigns of passive resistance strikes in coal and steel industries. Government printed more money, resulting in hyperinflation, depreciation of the mark and loss of confidence in the government. In 1924, Dawes Plan was introduced, giving Germany a foreign loan of 800 million gold marks. Germany was supposed to pay what she could every year. International tensions relaxed and German economy began to recover. In 1929, the Young Plan was introduced, reducing total reparations to £2000 million to be paid over 59 years. There was also a new loan of US$60 million. However, due to the Great Depression, Germany was released from most of her debts.

The political terms included the establishment of League of Nations, which aimed to be an international peace keeping organisation to maintain global peace. Another political term was to arrest and trial the Kaiser and other war criminals. It was not fulfilled as the Kaiser fled and was never tried for his actions.
