USSR saw China as a potential ally, but China would need a democratic revolution first. CCP was not well recognized because it had small membership and little influence with workers. In August 1922, Moscow sent a diplomatic mission to Peking under Adolph Joffee. In June 1923, urged by Comintern, the First United Front, which aimed to free the Chinese from yokes of powerful militarists and foreigners, was formed with KMT as the central force. CCP was to assist KMT and abide by its order and discipline. KMT planned to use CCP’s ties with workers and peasants to reorganize itself. CCP wanted to use the KMT base to expand their influence and subvert it from within.

KMT leader Sun Yat Sen died on 12 March 1925. His successor Chiang Kai Shek embarked on the Northern Expedition soon after. CCP wanted to march north to liberate more peasants and try to seize China once warlords were defeated. In July 1926, Chiang made a 2 pronged attack. One attacked Wuhan while the other split off to attack Nanzhang, Nanjing and Shanghai eastwards. KMT and CCP competed for support. By March 1927, the nationalist army overran half the area dominated by warlords.

However, by now communist activities like nationalizing and using trade unions to organize worker demands for better conditions troubled Chiang’s capitalist support base, increasing fears of communist revolution. Chiang was pressurized to end the alliance. With KMT influence extended and warlord threat dampened, the front collapsed.

Chiang decided to seize Shanghai as it had many communists and cut the power of USSR and CCP. Upon Chiang’s arrival, a general strike broke out. Execution squads were sent to kill suspected communists. A murder campaign was held against the communists amidst confusion. This was the Shanghai Massacre. CCP retreated to the countryside. After 1927, CCP split into 2 groups. Mao’s group worked on peasant revolution while Chinese Bolsheviks worked on permanent revolution.

Chiang created a fully nationalist government and proclaimed Nanjing the capital of Nationalist Republic of China. In the second phase of Northern expedition, the warlords were defeated. KMT struggled to modernize China but land reforms were not introduced and peasants remained oppressed.

From 1930-1934, Chiang embarked on a series of extermination campaigns in a bid to destroy communist bases and threats.

In late 1930, the first campaign to suppress the remaining Communists and bandits in the middle Yangtze region failed terribly. The outnumbered Communist Red Army superior use of guerilla warfare, which lured enemies and launched surprise attacks on them, and mountainous terrain, caused the Nationalist Army to lose 2 divisions. Much of KMT’s weapons and equipment were captured when they tried to attack the Communists again. Successive defeats were the trend for next 3 KMT campaigns.

The second campaign launched in February 1931 had same tactics employed by each side. On July 1 1931, the third campaign was launched. Chiang assumed command with 100000 more troops. Both sides suffered heavy losses when the communists counter attacked in the decisive battle from 7-9 September. The campaign was called off when Japan invaded Manchuria.

The fourth campaign began in April 1933, the same time the Japanese breached the Great Wall. CCP’s territorial holdings increased with the defeat of KMT forces. Chiang had to call off the campaign when Japan took Jehol in North China.

Fifth campaign began in October 1933. German General von Seeckt’s strategy of strangulation, blockade and encirclement was used. A blockade formed cut communication lines, supplies and trade around the communist area. Communists Red Army struggled and broke out of encirclement. They were further plagued by failed military strategy and diseases. They abandoned bases and this led to the Long March.

90000 thousand men broke out of Jiangxi on 19 October 1934. Red Army’s defeat by Chiang’s troops at Xiang River was discredited and due to their military inexperience and attempt to expel Mao Zedong from CCP, they got driven west. On January 15, a 3 days meeting at Zunyi elevated Mao to the position of Party Secretary.

Red Army found the direct route to Sichuan blocked by Chiang’s forces. A brilliant series of maneuvers enabled Mao and his troops to cross the Yangtse on May 8 and escape Chiang’s troops, which clashed with the warlords’. Mao finally met up with Zhang after crossing the Luding Bridge and Great Snowy Mountains. Despite the initial alliance, Zhang and Mao fell out when Zhang opposed the Zunyi decision and also wished to head the direction opposite of what Mao had planned. On September 9, he ordered his troops to capture Mao but fortunately, Mao fled and arrived safely in Shanxi, their new communist base. The remnants of the Red Army, some 8000 men, eventually arrived in Shanxi in October 1935.
